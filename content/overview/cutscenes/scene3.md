STOU and CASSANDRA notice the main force bypassed their ambush and is marching on South Keep.

##### Cassandra

> The whole of their forces approaches the city!

##### Stou

> How did they get past us?

##### Cassandra

> It seems the attack was but a small diversion all the while the real threat marched from the south.

##### Stou

> They knew we were waiting. But ... how?

##### Cassandra

> Perhaps ... a traitor?

##### TODO / DISCUSS

- [ ] Intro. Calls it a city, but earlier she calls it a town. I'd say either call town, or South Keep here.
- [ ] Don't love intro of "the whole of their forces".
- [ ] GLOBAL - ripple in water, flags in bg, quality of Cassy's staff
