STOU and ALFRIC and CASSANDRA examining an invaders corpse.

#### Cassandra

> These markings, this soldier is from the Drylands. This makes no sense. What would prompt such an attack?

#### Stou

> We need to find out. We'll track those who escaped.
                        
#### Barric

> No. We must return `to South Keep` and warn our people.

#### Stou

> Turn back? And what then, Barric? Wait to be attacked again? How many lost their lives today? We must hold them responsible!

#### Barric

> Stou, what do you know of war? Of loss?

#### Stou

> I know that running isn't the answer.

#### Barric

> Your youth betrays you, and I will not let a boys blind bloodlust get more people killed.

#### Cassandra

> Gentlemen. Perhaps a compromise is in order. Barric, you may ride to warn the town while Stou and I lie in wait should anyone persue you.

#### Barric

> My priority is my people. Do as you see fit. I ride immediately.
