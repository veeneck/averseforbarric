STOU and CASSANDRA interrogating ISS'DAR after the battle.

##### Stou

> Why do you attack us? Who leads this assault? Tell me, now.

##### Iss'dar

> You fool. The answer is in front of you.

##### Stou

> You dare give me riddles?

##### Iss'dar

> Are you so blind? You've been betrayed.

***

Enemy army appears on the horizon.

##### Stou

> We were followed ... how? They didn't know we were here.

##### Cassandra

> Now is not the time, Stou. We are outnumbered. We must retreat. Now.
