[Current cutscene implementation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ih58gvvi9ibcqtn/WaW_OopsAndSurrounding.mp4?raw=1)

No dialogue. STOU kills BARRIC, and flashbacks explain how he was set up.

### TODO / DISCUSS

- [ ] Decide if we want snow or not.
- [ ] Fix flashbacks based off of updated visuals.
- [ ] 09:19 - Glint chains to highlight he was captive
- [ ] NOTES: Travel dialogue to hammer home that she orchestrated all of this.
