STOU has snuck through enemy lines while CASSANDRA catches him on his way to Wellspring.

##### Cassandra

> Stou! I've ridden all night to catch you!

##### Stou

> Cassandra? What are you doing here? You were to notify the council.

##### Cassandra

> I ... your brother. I had to come immediately. Barric. He left `South Keep` shortly after ~~you~~ `we did` ... with those who stand against us. I fear he may be the one behind this.

##### Stou

> That's impossible.

##### Cassandra

> It was him. My men confirmed it.

##### Stou

> Your men are mistaken. My brother would never betray our people.

##### Cassandra

> Our scouts saw him amongst their ranks. Stou, I'm so ...

##### Stou

> No you're wrong. There is an explanation, and we're going to find it.
