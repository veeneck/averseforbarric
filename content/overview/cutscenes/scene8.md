STOU and CASSANDRA at crossroads deciding next steps.

### Stou

> Still they persist.

### Cassandra

> Perhaps, we should split up.

### Stou

> I don't enjoy the idea of dividing our forces. Or, of leaving you.

### Cassandra

> Nor do I, but hear me. Lure them into the mountains, distract them, I will alert the council.

### Stou

> I don't like this, Cassandra. But, you're right. We don't have many options.

### Cassandra

> Head ~~for my town in the mountains~~ `up Giant's Pass to my Manor`. You will be welcomed.

### Stou

> Be careful.

### Cassandra

> I will. And Stou, don't hesitate.
