STOU and CASSANDRA preparing for the final battle.

##### Cassandra

> Oh, Stou. I'm surprised you made it this far. For what it's worth, I respected your brother. Despite the fact he took everything from me. My father. My kingdom. My heritage. Was he so foolish as to think that a discarded mountain city would be suitable for one such as myself? For royalty? My birthright is to rule. And that time is upon us. You will all bow before your queen. Do not dare stand in my way.

##### TODO / DISCUSS

- [ ] Closeup / Increasing staff glow / more dramatic movement / breathing / alternate Stou face
