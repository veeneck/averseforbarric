STOU and ARCHER are atop Drysgate discussing the siege.

### Stou

> Report?

### Archer

> They're attacking with scout groups. Pinning us back as they continue to grow their ranks.

### Stou

> Do we know why they're attacking?

### Archer

> No, sir. They've sent no messages. Only arrows.

### Stou

> And who is that? Who leads them?

### Archer

> The man in the cloak? We're not sure. It's the first we've seen of him.

### Stou

> I need answers, soldier. I'll have to get through.

### Archer

> There may be a clearing, sir, after the next wave of attacks.

### TODO / DISCUSS

- [ ] 05:34 - Fix Fence break /  Clean up Stou
- [ ] Archer is blue archer mode. Need to replace with crossbowmen or longbowmen since that unit is now an enemy unit.
