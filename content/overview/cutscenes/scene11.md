STOU and ALFRIC resume there conversation from the beginning of the game, explaining why they're gathered for war.

### Stou

> That's why we're gathered here to fight.

### Alfric

> So, Barric is truly gone then. It hurts to say that out loud. That traitorous b... clearly her father's blood runs deep. 

### Stou

> What news of her army?

### Alfric

> She marches for the castle. I expect they'll lay siege within ~~a day~~ `the week`.

### Stou

> She will answer for this.

### Alfric

> Lad, know that I'm sorry for your loss. For all you've endured, I'm glad that you are here. You give us a cause to fight for. On my honor, we will preserve what Barric stood for.

### Stou

> We march in the morning.

### TODO / DISCUSS

- [ ] Change day to week since the player is a defender in the finally battle, and would need to reach the castle before Cassy does.
- [ ] "We march in the morning" feels like a weak closing line. Discuss.
- [ ] Fix Clouds / Lance / Use extra Alfric faces
- [ ] Additional art could be used here ... not sure what though. Ice trail from Cassie on map
