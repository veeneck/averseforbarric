STOU and ALFRIC gathered amongst soldiers setting up camp.

##### Stou

> You've met my brother, Barric?

##### Alfric

> Met him? I've fought with him, and would again. Fine warrior, and a better man.

##### Stou

> I never knew that side of him. I've only heard stories.

##### Alfric

> Story like his ... words only carry so much. Don't do it justice. Barric saved this kingdom.

> Some say it was poison; others, a thirst for power that drove the king mad those years ago. The man was ruthless. All of us slaves to his greed, his twisted lust. All who opposed the mighty ~~Luthas~~ `Luthen` were exiled to the Drylands, and gods know death would be far kinder than being sent to that lawless place. As a general, this task was left to Barric to enforce.

##### Stou

> Was this before Sara ...

##### Alfric

> Aye, before Sara was ... taken. But even with what those barbarians did to his wife, it wasn't until your nephew died ... losing his only son ... changed him.

##### Stou

> Barric never spoke of his loss.

##### Alfric

> But he did act upon it. It was Barric that organized the uprising against ~~Luthas~~ `Luthen`. Got word to each of the elder lords. It was not an easy battle, nor a short one. But over the kings body, in their victory, the six lords split power over our kingdom. Bound by the blood of a tyrant, each vowed to never again to be at the mercy of one.

##### Stou

> And what of the king's daughter?

##### Alfric

> Aye, Cassy was but a child. Maybe too young to even understand. The princess was an innocent. She had taken an unusual liking to ice, so the group of us took her north. Carved out a region tucked deep into the mountains of Arrington for her to rule as lord when she was of age.

> You know the rest, boy. Now, tell me, why are we gathered here for war?

##### Stou

> Each fall we'd head up to the mountains on a supply run. It's a good haul, but we all knew Barric made the run mostly because of Cassy. Of course, it never bothered me. It helped her people get through the tough winters and, truthfully, I welcomed any opportunity to catch her eye. This year was no different.

Transition to STOU and BARRIC escorting CASSANDRA and supplies 3 weeks earlier.

##### Barric

> Let's set up camp over there.

> You be careful with her now.

##### Stou

> Heh, don't you worry. I can handle a pretty girl.

##### Barric

> She's not just a girl, Stou.  She's a princess, and a mage.

##### Stou

> Just worry about resting your old arse.

##### Barric

> Still ~~old~~ `young` enough to whoop you.

##### Stou

> Yeah, yeah, get some sleep. I'll take first watch.

> AMBUSH!
