STOU and CASSANDRA consult with BARRIC after the battle at SOUTH KEEP

### Cassandra

> Our ambush was avoided.

### Barric

> I know, and had we pressed the attack, our city would have been left defenseless. We must not overreact.

### Stou

> Overreact? They attacked our city, Barric. Our home!

### Barric

> And who exactly are "they"?

### Stou

> This matters when they bring war to our very doorstep?

### Barric

> Their boldness is precisely why we must remain calm, Stou. Before all else, the council must be notified.

### Stou

> I don't want to talk, Barric. I'll put my time to better use -- in preparation for battle.

### Barric

> ENOUGH! You've seen what war has done to our people. I won't let it consume you as it did me. A drawn blade must always be a last resort. You ride to notify the council.

STOU and CASSANDRA share a conversation outside after leaving the hall.

### Cassandra

> Stou, I know it is not my place to say it, but some decisions must be made without hesitation. The time to trust your instincts may soon come.
