This is just a dump of ideas. Add them here for future brainstorming.

### Major Game Engine Features To Be Considered

Code that I haven't added yet.

- [ ] Flanking bonus
- [ ] Strategic positions
- [ ] Treasure chests
- [ ] Larger maps
- [ ] Heroes
- [ ] Items
- [ ] Difficulty Level
- [ ] Boss Fights
- [ ] Player places units
- [ ] Hidden units (i.e: placed behind tree)

### Difficulty Level

Games are annoying when you have to start them over completely -- especially story heavy games. One option is to offer easy mode and normal mode. Normal mode has units dying after combat that need to be healed. Easy mode means all troops survive the battle. Switching to easy mode from normal mode could replenish troops if the player gets stuck on a level. A step further would be to lower enemy stats too ... brainstorm this.

On same note ... games like XCom start medium hard, and then transition to balanced and then to the player feeling like a super hero. Aim to make level 1-4 challenging, 4-8 fair, and 9-12 start swinging in players favor.

### Strategic Position / Treasure Chests / Teleport

There has to be motivation to lure the player out of the turtle shell tactic. Three ideas are:

- Treasure Chests: Place them far away so the player has to risk a unit to go get them. Good rewards.
- Strategic Position: Hotspots thought the map that are designed bottlenecks that give bonuses if you set up your units in them.
- Teleport: Make one spell line teleport a friendly unit, and maybe teleport / invisible when upgraded, and recall after 10 seconds for final upgrade. Encourage you to get behind enemy for flanking bonus, fight a bit, and then teleport back to safety.

### Heroes & Items

- Heroes will still make it in, I just need to find out how to balance them once Stou's spells and unit balance is in.
- Items are a maybe. Thinking of taking the shop concept away completely, and just rewarding items after combat that can be equipped in the camp scene.

### Controlled Flee

As units level up, make their flee less random -- make them flee towards friendlies? Potential strategy to overextend, then flee back to help and healing. Needs testing.

### Ideas

What sort of interesting encounters could there be to challenge the player?

* Enemies resistant to magic would force aggressive and controlling players to stall, panic, and use other spells they may have found.
* A single suicide / bomb enemy could target a squad, forcing the player to react within a certain amount of time.
* Undead style effect could prevent units from being revived, and instead turn them into fighting for the enemy.
* Ranged units, followed by melee, could force player to engage further out of comfort zone (requires bigger maps)
* Invisible units can attack the back lines unexpectedly.
* Flying units could only be killed by archers and magic.
* Treasure chest on battlefield that drop spells and equipment force the player out of position.
* Escort / get to the other side of map. Add timer? Thinking of level 7.
* Let players position army before battle starts.
* Lock Stou from changing strategies for a period of time. Forces player to gravity towards one spell family.
* Teleport units who aren't engaged towards back lines. Player will have to stop all friendly fire, and try to heal / kill enemy quickly.
* Cloak / invisible spell to make invisible or to reduce damage taken by enemy war machines and archers. Give melee units a chance to get to back lines.
* Make one squad not in formation..more of a wandering squad in random positions.
