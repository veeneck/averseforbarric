<img align="left" src="/images/abilities/icon_Protective.png?raw=true" class="unit" />**Low damage, low control, low debuffs, high healing.** 

Protective spells are meant to keep your friendlies alive. This is done by direct healing, revival, or by limiting the amount of damage an enemy can do. Crowd control is minimal, with Hammer being the only hope of Fear / Stun in a hard fight. Healing can be boring, so one future task is to brainstorm creative ways to add variety to healing. All of the spells use Water / Magic as the element. 

##### Heal

|   |           Level 1          |        Level 2        |                      Level 3                      |

##### Hammer
