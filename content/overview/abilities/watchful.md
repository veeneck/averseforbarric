Watchful spells are well balanced. They should be able to heal units, buff units, resist damage, do damage, and offer crowd control. All while being the master of none. If the player preempts everything that is about to happen, Watchful should feel a bit overpowered. But, it should feel underpowered if the player is being reactive. For example, Regen should not save a unit close to death, but it should keep a unit alive is constantly applied throughout the fight. All of the spells use Nature as the element. 

##### Regen

##### Haste

##### Thorn Trap

| Implemented | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

_**Notes**_: Great spell, but have to make sure it isn't more controlling than Mesmerize, and doesn't do more damage than Fireball.

##### Scout (passive)
|   |                    Level 1                   |        Level 2       |              Level 3             |

| Implemented | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

_**Notes**_: Have to see who fun it is having to switch to Watchful stance to see upcoming spawns. Also, is Level 3 compelling enough to want to upgrade this branch?

##### Training (passive)
|   |          Level 1          |               Level 2              |               Level 3              |

_**Notes**_: A Trebuchet that can fire further and is more likely to hit could be one of the more overpowered options.
