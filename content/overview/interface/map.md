The world map serves as the main way to show passage of time or travel. Aside from that, it also builds the setting and acts as a hub where the player can manage their army. The main characters in this world are:

- **Barric**: One of the council lords, and Stou's older brother.
- **Stou**: Barric's younger brother who the player is controlling.
- **Alfric**: The knight Stou is talking to at the beginning. One of the council members, Barric's equal.
- **Cassandra**: Princess. Daughter to King Luthen who was overthrown by Barric. Barric still helps her. Stou has a crush.
- **The council**: Collection of Lords who oversee laws of Endria. Barric and Alfric are members.
- **King Luthen**: The previous ruler that Barric overthrew.

As the player makes their way through the game, the World Map will anchor the following events:

##### Level 2 Reveal

The player gets their first Stou upgrade point. Place tha map in tutorial mode to force the player to click on Stou's abilities and at least view the upgrade panel before unlocking and setting the map back into normal mode.

##### Level 3 Reveal

Walk the user through recruiting units, healing units, and unit upgrades which can all be found in the Camp scene accessed from the World Map. By this level, the player should have enough experience to guarantee at least one squad has leveled up.

##### Level 11 Reveal

Dialogue in Level 10 indicates some of the council has heard of the war, and is setting up camp southeast of the castle. When travel dialogue from 10-11 shows, the camp will now be there on the world map. The image to the right is placed right on top of the existing map near Wheatsbury.

##### Interaction

Throughout the game, I would like for their to be a few hidden achievements, or just fun easter eggs. The map has art for the following:

- Tap swordsman and he'll raise his sword
- Tap sheep and they'll baahh
- Tap tall building and it will light up
- Tap southwest house and smoke will come out of its roof
