Notes to consider:

* As Stou and units level up, make their icon housing slightly cooler based on their level.
* Make Stou's /  units card more elaborate also as it levels up.
* When Stou is casting, animate his card in some way.
* Make the card the thing you tap to change casting stance, and get rid of strategy button.
* Focus on gate opening UI and effects -- if that indicates the start of a wave, the player needs to know. Even more so if some of the spells will trigger when the next wave starts.
* Make two circles left and right of gate to indicate passive spells that are currently active.
  * Bonus: Slightly change appearance of gate / wall based on Stou's active spell category.
