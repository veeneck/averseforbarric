As each level is completed, the next level is revealed. This seemed like a good time to add some character building. It also serves as a vehicle to drop hints or influence the way the player may feel. So, for now, the implementation is to gradually reveal footsteps and have Stou speak in the background about current events and thoughts. Each segment takes around 7 to 12 seconds. Tony added a background track that can fade into the main World map track once the dialogue is complete. **Spoilers Below**.

<span class="circle">1</span> to <span class="circle">2</span>

> The border clans haven’t attacked us like this in years. Who's organizing this? And why? No matter ... if it's a fight they want, it's a fight they'll get.

<span class="circle">2</span> to <span class="circle">3</span>

> They're well trained. And well armed. This must be an organized invasion. Good, I'm ready to prove myself.

<span class="circle">3</span> to <span class="circle">3a</span>

> My brother is as stubborn as an ox. While he wastes time with words our enemy gathers. Eventually, I will greet those who threaten us.

<span class="circle">3a</span> to <span class="circle">4</span>

> Good, the princess will spread the word while I head to the front lines to see first hand what's really happening.

<span class="circle">4</span> to <span class="circle">5</span>

> Even as they press further into our lands, we still know nothing of our enemy, their leader, or their motivations. I must find answers.

<span class="circle">5</span> to <span class="circle">6</span>

> Something’s not right. Barric would never destroy what he fought so hard to preserve. Would he? What am I missing?

<span class="circle">6</span> to <span class="circle">7</span>

> Even in death these cowards believe that their cause is just. Why are they so relentless? I fear we may never discover the truth.

<span class="circle">7</span> to <span class="circle">8</span>

> Our enemies’ numbers continue to grow like a weed. Cassandra must reach the council and secure their aid. I only hope it’s not too late.

<span class="circle">8</span> to <span class="circle">9</span>

> Their main forces aren't far behind. We must hurry to Wintry Manor for reinforcements, and to make a stand.

<span class="circle">9</span> to <span class="circle">10</span>

Silence, to try to create a dramatic effect indicating Stou is sorry for Barric's death. World map music may be toned down / altered during this sequence too. Or, use dialogue to explain to players who didn't follow that she did this.

> Cassandra ... power isn't enough for you? You had to manipulate me ... to use me against my own family? 

<span class="circle">10</span> to <span class="circle">11</span>

> A friendly force gathers nearby. There is still a chance to preserve what Barric sacrificed so much for. I owe it to my brother to try and help.

OR

> My brothers spirit lives on. I will join the rally to support all that he sacrificed for. Barric ... I'm so sorry.

<span class="circle">11</span> to <span class="circle">12</span>

> I stoked the flames of war and they engulfed everything I touched. Barric died because of me. Because I wouldn’t listen, and now everything he fought to protect, could be destroyed. Cassandra must be stopped.
