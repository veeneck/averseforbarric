After Level 4 : Border, a decision level will appear on the world map (same as when Cassandra diverted Stou to border). Note: Have to decide if this is played out in the battle view, or just in Decision mode.

> A word, stranger? We're not sure why our brother are invading your lands, but we do not approve. Something evil is motivating them, and we hope to stop it. May we join your ranks?

If the user answers yes, they join. Otherwise, they follow, and automatically get added during the battle either midway through Level 5 : Desert or at the begging of Level 6 : Oasis by saying something along the lines of "We know you didn't trust us, so hopefully we can prove our loyalty and earn your trust."
