After combat, Stou has the option to loot the city.

> As you retreat from the city, you notice valuable artifacts in storefronts. Do you want to order your men to grab what they can, or leave the city folk and their belongings untouched?

Two potential outcomes to brainstorm here.

1. Spearmen stay/go depending on decision.

a. If you loot, you get an item, a spell, food and gold. The food/ gold will allow you to strengthen existing forces. You'll need this to counter the fact that the spearmen now leave you since you're not honorable.

b. Spearmen respect you even more. A few more locals join your ranks. They offer you a spell of their knowledge?

2. Rogues join your party earlier, and either spearmen / rogues stay go.

The big **if** here is whether or not rogues should join the party after level 5. And then, based on this choice, rogues stay if you loot, spearmen stay if you go. 

Have to decide if it's realistic to implement rogues as friendlies, and which is more fun.
