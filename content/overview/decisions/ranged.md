Before Level 4 : Border, Stou will be given a choice between crossbowmen and longbowmen.

> You'll need some arrows to keep the waves at bay. Have a squad of mine. Longbowmen can shoot over obstacles at great distance. Crossbowmen don't shoot as far, but they sure do pack a punch.

Since the crazy enemy that charges into troops and explodes is introduced, the extra archers will help kill them before they can do major damage.
