Some sort of decision that would allow the giant to join your party. Ideas:

1. In combat, hint that you shouldn't kill the giant. If you do, you get cool loot. If you leave him along, he'll attack the enemy, and join you after the battle.

2. Same concept, but just in the decision screen. After battle, notice giant is wounded. Heal him and leave, or finish him off. Rewards are the same.
