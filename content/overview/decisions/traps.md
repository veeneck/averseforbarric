> The steep, snowy terrain has slowed down your march. Enemy scouting parties will catch up any day now. Should we set up traps, or fortify our defenses?

Traps could make the enemy spawn damaged, or even have a visual like snow falling. Fortify could put barriers down that the enemy has to break, or increase defense.
