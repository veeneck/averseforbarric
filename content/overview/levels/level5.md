> During a pause in the border assault, a clearing allowed Stou to venture further into the Drylands so that he could learn more about the invaders. While traveling to Wellspring, Cassandra caught up in a panic and notified him that Barric was seen with the enemy, and may be organizing the attacks.

### First Cutscene

Stou's army moves into position. Rogues standing on bridge stop them.

#### Rogue

> Gentlemen. A small request. Just leave us your coin and food, and we'll be on our way.

#### Stou

> Robbery during war time. Honorable, aren't you? We don't have time for this. You're outnumbered.

#### Rogue

> Suit yourself. This place is crawling with border patrols though, so you never know when the odds will change. Watch your backs. 

Rogues go invisible

> Oh, and don't try to catch us.

Bridge blows up.

:performing_arts: `Introduce rogues, and hint that they can go invisible. After that, just normal waves for the player to get established on the level.`

***

### Second Cutscene

Rogues try a sneak attack. Spearmen spot them, and fight them off. If you declined spearmen in decision screen, they will come in from off screen and save you.

**If you decline spearmen, the cutscene will make it look like they are coming from off screen to attack you, and then last second the rogues appear and they kill the rogues.**

#### Spearmen

> To the south! Watch out!

#### Rogue

> You didn't think that we had left the party, did you?

Rogues appear and engage. Spearmen fight them off. Rogues appear to die.

#### Spearmen

> Rogues are all over these canyons. No loyalty, no fear. They're also very hard to kill. Stay vigilant.

:performing_arts: `Explain to the player the concept of invisibility.`

***

### Third Cutscene

Rogues come back for final attack. They revive with 25% health from feign death.

#### Rogue

> You keep underestimating us, my friend.

#### Stou

> How's this possible?

#### Spearmen

> Like I said, they're hard to kill. Tricks and deception. They'll fake their death to get an advantage.

:performing_arts: `Player should now understand feign death. Finish off rogues, and then start waves.`

***

### Fourth Cutscene

Make progress towards next level. Move out of the canyon.

#### Stou

> We've got to get out of these canyons. We're wasting time here.

#### Spearmen

> Wellspring is just north, not too far ahead.

#### Lemon Knight

> Should we approach from the high ground or low ground?

#### Stou

> I'd like to stay flexible. Let's split up and cover both so that we can scout the city.

:performing_arts: `Make two objectives appear. 1 archer and 1 melee must make it to each objective, and then the map is complete.`
