> During a pause in the border assault, a clearing allowed Stou to venture further into the Drylands so that he could learn more about the invaders. While traveling to Wellspring, Cassandra caught up in a panic and notified him that Barric was seen with the enemy, and may be organizing the attacks.

##### Red Canyon

Introduce the user to the concept of invisible units. Also, an interesting side mission to the standard plot.

##### First Cutscene

Stou's army moves into position. Rogues standing on bridge stop them.

<div class="container">
<div class="idiriBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Rogue</p></div>
<blockquote>Gentlemen. A small request. Just leave us your coin and food, and we'll be on our way.</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="stouBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Stou</p></div>
<blockquote>Robbery during war time. Honorable, aren't you? We don't have time for this. You're outnumbered.</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="idiriBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Rogue</p></div>
<blockquote>Suit yourself. This place is crawling with border patrols though, so you never know when the odds will change. Watch your backs. </blockquote>
</div>

Rogues go invisible

<div class="container">
<div class="idiriBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Rogue</p></div>
<blockquote>Oh, and don't try to catch us.</blockquote>
</div>

Bridge blows up.

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Introduce rogues, and hint that they can go invisible. After that, just normal waves for the player to get established on the level.</code></p>

##### Second Cutscene

Rogues try a sneak attack. Spearmen spot them, and fight them off. If you declined spearmen in decision screen, they will come in from off screen and save you.

**If you decline spearmen, the cutscene will make it look like they are coming from off screen to attack you, and then last second the rogues appear and they kill the rogues.**

<div class="container">
<div class="peasantBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Spearmen</p></div>
<blockquote>To the south! Watch out!</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="idiriBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Rogue</p></div>
<blockquote>You didn't think that we had left the party, did you?</blockquote>
</div>

Rogues appear and engage. Spearmen fight them off. Rogues appear to die.

<div class="container">
<div class="peasantBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Spearmen</p></div>
<blockquote>Rogues are all over these canyons. No loyalty, no fear. They're also very hard to kill. Stay vigilant.</blockquote>
</div>

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Explain to the player the concept of invisibility.</code></p>

##### Third Cutscene

Rogues come back for final attack. They revive with 25% health from feign death.

<div class="container">
<div class="idiriBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Rogue</p></div>
<blockquote>You keep underestimating us, my friend.</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="stouBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Stou</p></div>
<blockquote>How's this possible?</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="peasantBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Spearmen</p></div>
<blockquote>Like I said, they're hard to kill. Tricks and deception. They'll fake their death to get an advantage.</blockquote>
</div>

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Player should now understand feign death. Finish off rogues, and then start waves.</code></p>

##### Fourth Cutscene

Make progress towards next level. Move out of the canyon.

<div class="container">
<div class="stouBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Stou</p></div>
<blockquote>We've got to get out of these canyons. We're wasting time here.</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="peasantBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Spearmen</p></div>
<blockquote>Wellspring is just north, not too far ahead.</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="lemonBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Lemon</p></div>
<blockquote>Should we approach from the high ground or low ground?</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="stouBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Stou</p></div>
<blockquote>I'd like to stay flexible. Let's split up and cover both so that we can scout the city.</blockquote>
</div>

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Make two objectives appear. 1 archer and 1 melee must make it to each objective, and then the map is complete.</code></p>
