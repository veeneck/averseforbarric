> Barric refused to make a rash judgement regarding the intruders. Set in his resolve, he returned to South Keep to gather more information. Meanwhile, anxious to punish their attackers, Stou and Cassandra set up an ambush should the enemy pursue.

### First Cutscene

An enemy scouting party is passing by the ambush site. Watching it pass provides an opportunity to foreshadow future units that the player will have to fight.

#### Lemon Knight

> Sir! Scouts report movement behind us.

#### Stou

> So, they did persue. They won't be expecting us. Why isn't the Trebuchet / Catapult in position?

#### Lemon Knight

> We're making the final adjustments. It should be ready soon!

### Stou

> Hurry up! Let this first wave pass. I'll see if any spells can maintain our advantage.

:performing_arts: `The goal here is to show how to switch spell categories, and explain where passive spell effects are shown in the UI.`

### Second Cutscene

Either [Trebuchet or Catapult](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#trebuchet--trebram) roll into position, depending on the players [decision](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-War-Machine).

#### Lemon Knight

> Moving the Trebuchet / Catapult into position!

#### Stou

> Load it up, boys! Prepare to fire while we still have the advantage.

:performing_arts: `Second waves are easy, and give the player a chance to play with the war machine. This is a good spot to explain friendly fire, and how to stop attacking.`

***

### Third Cutscene

Pan camera to strategic position. Delay for a time, and then spawn an enemy with a [Champion : Legionaire](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#champion--legionaire).

#### Stou

> Soldier! Set up defenses along the ridge. That position should provide cover.

#### Lemon Knight

> Yessir!

#### Stou

> And be careful, men. It looks as if more experienced troops are entering the fray.

:performing_arts: `Immediately after cutscene, go over strategic points tutorial. After that, pan to incoming squad with a champion, and point out the bonuses they provide.`
