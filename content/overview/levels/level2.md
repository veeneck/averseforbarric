##### Highlands

This level teaches the player how to switch spell categories, control war machines, friendly fire and strategic positions, and enemy champions. A unit is also guaranteed to level up here, which will teach the player how to pick skills in the Camp scene.

##### First Cutscene

An enemy scouting party is passing by the ambush site. Watching it pass provides an opportunity to foreshadow future units that the player will have to fight.

<blockquote>So, they did persue. They won't be expecting us. Why isn't the Trebuchet / Catapult in position?</blockquote>

##### Second Cutscene

Either [Trebuchet or Catapult](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#trebuchet--trebram) roll into position, depending on the players [decision](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-War-Machine).

##### Third Cutscene

Pan camera to strategic position. Delay for a time, and then spawn an enemy with a [Champion : Legionaire](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#champion--legionaire).
