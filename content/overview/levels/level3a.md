### Table Lakes

This level has no combat, so it should be a cool experience for the player. Army is marching through terrain, and Cassandra approaches surround by her person guard and 2 squads of Melee2 knights. She explains the situation to Stou, and he changes paths to go to the border while she moves towards council.
