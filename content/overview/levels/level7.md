> With such a large army in pursuit, Stou and Cassandra were left with no choice but to flee back towards Endria's mainland. Annoyed that he was left with riddles instead of answers, Stou opened his mind to the possibility that his brother would betray him.

### Border Steppes

Phase 1, rescue guys near house:

"Stou!, Sorry, er...sir. You helped us back in Barric's City. We figured we'd return the favor. Got word you went to the border. Thought you might need a hand."

Phase 2, guys explain it's hard to get back to mainland.

"The enemy is swarming everywhere. This lot has been waiting at the border to prevent any crossing back in. Etc etc"

Phase 3, start escort mission, pushing up to various ledges for archers and catapults to get shots on.
