> Stou and Cassandra suspect an insider may have alerted the enemy to their trap since the bulk of the invading forces are now unscathed, marching on South Keep. With little time to ponder, they rush to Barric's aid.

##### South Keep

Intro to the first enemy boss, treasure chests, a defensive objective (if enemy destroys the gate, they win), and the first true gameplay choice with strategic positions (over extend and risk getting flanked).

This is also the first boss fight, so if there is a custom UI for bosses or any other unique behavior, it will be introduced here.

##### First Cutscene

City is burning, and some units have entered from the streets at the top of the map. NPC's defending, explain that the gate must be protected at all costs. Stou and his army come in from the South to fend off the first wave.

<blockquote>Reinforce! Defend the castle! Do not let them destroy the gate!</blockquote>
</div>

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Consider tutorial overlay explaining new objective -- the gate can be attacked by enemies. Or, give the gate a health bar somewhere in the UI.</code></p>

##### Second Cutscene

Fade to black, reposition players army in defense positions within the city. Add treasure chest to map in a place that would compromise objective. Either by docks so the player has to walk out of their way, or far into enemy spawns that it would be impossible to get this wave and the player can think about it during future breaks.

Fade to black and reposition troops.

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Good chance to get a feel for the waves, and the strategic positions on the map. Also, first look at treasure chests (consider tutorial).</code></p>

##### Third Cutscene

Enemy Boss : Shaman appears in a protected position. Can cast spells just as Stou can. 

<div class="container">
<div class="barricBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Barric</p></div>
<blockquote>They've got a shaman with them! Watch out for spells, men. Hold your ground!</blockquote>
</div>

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Camera pans to new boss unit. First look at being the target of spells.</code></p>

##### Fourth Cutscene

TBD how Shaman boss fight plays out. Most likely open up new wave area (docks) and have Shaman cast spells off screen for awhile before becoming an attackable unit.
