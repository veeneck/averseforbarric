##### Wooden Falls

This level introduces the player to movement, melee combat/charging, ranged combat, unit resistances and casting spells. It also teaches the player about the threat of enemy archers, and the concept of incoming waves of enemies.

##### First Cutscene

NPC troops are dying to [BadMelee1 : Border Squires](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#bad-melee-1--border-squires) in the center of the map. [Melee1 : Lemon Knights](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#melee-1--lemon-knights) enter scene from camp for player to take control.

##### Second Cutscene

Add [Archer1 : Redwood Bowmen](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#archer-1--redwood-bowmen) to the battle. Encourage player to move to the high ground.

##### Third Cutscene

[BadArcher1 : Border Hunters](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#bad-archer-1--border-hunter) moves into position across the bridge.

[Melee2 : Ice Guard](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#melee-2--ice-guard) appear from camp and start engaging enemy archers. 

Player kills enemy archers, and the final waves start to let the player explore for a minute on their own.
