#### Summary

This level introduces the player to movement, melee combat/charging, ranged combat, unit resistances and casting spells. It also teaches the player about the threat of enemy archers, and the concept of incoming waves of enemies.

### First Cutscene

NPC troops are dying to [BadMelee1 : Border Squires](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#bad-melee-1--border-squires) in the center of the map. [Melee1 : Lemon Knights](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#melee-1--lemon-knights) enter scene from camp for player to take control.

#### Barric

> To arms! We're under attack! Stou, defend the entrance with these soldiers. I'll secure the camp. You're in command.

:performing_arts: `Player controls Melee1 and attacks NPC. When in Charge range, game pauses and explains the charge distance.`

***

### Second Cutscene

Add [Archer1 : Redwood Bowmen](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#archer-1--redwood-bowmen) to the battle. Encourage player to move to the high ground.

#### Stou

> More troops are approaching.

#### Barric

> We need to secure the high ground. Send archers to the hill.

#### Stou

> Keep the bridge covered!

:performing_arts: `A few BadMelee1 waves should come. The first should be a unit that is guaranteed to flee before it reaches the bridge. Game can pause and explain fleeing.`

***

### Third Cutscene

[BadArcher1 : Border Hunters](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#bad-archer-1--border-hunter) moves into position across the bridge.

#### Stou

> Their archers will pick us off. We need backup!

#### Cassandra

> Stou, my guard have heavier shields. Take a few of them to assist.

#### Barric

> And that magic that you've been dabbling in -- now would be a good time to use it.

[Melee2 : Ice Guard](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#melee-2--ice-guard) appear from camp and start engaging enemy archers. 

:performing_arts: `When cutscene ends, Stou's spell UI appears. Explains you can right click on anything to learn more. Show Ice guards resistance to piercing, and Stou's spell ability. Only 1 spell is available. (rest unlocked in world map)`

Player kills enemy archers, and the final waves start to let the player explore for a minute on their own.
