> While Barric ordered Stou to notify the council of the invasion, Cassandra alerted him to more pressing matters in the Drylands. Stou arrives at Drysgate to offer reinforcements for the siege while Cassandra, in his stead, agrees to notify the council lords.

##### Drysgate

This is the first battle that moves to the larger map format. The larger maps build up the anticpation of combat, and strategy becomes more of a factor. This map will also have an objective at the end -- make it to an escape region towards the top with X% of the army. This will need balance, but that is the general idea.

##### First Cutscene

Scouting party is returning with the enemy on their heels. Provide cover and defend a few waves.

<blockquote>Men, assume defensive positions! Let's provide cover for that scouting party. </blockquote>
</div>

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Friendly archers running from enemy. They position themselves on top of hill on the enemy side to make them vulnerable to Ykesha in next cutscene. General waves at this point.</code></p>

##### Second Cutscene

Introduction to Ykesha units. Fast moving, kamikaze style units. 

<div class="container">

<blockquote>Sir, what's that?</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">

</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="archerBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Archer</p></div>
<blockquote>They're fearless! They sacrifice themselves to do as much damage as they can. Help! Destroy them before they reach us.</blockquote>
</div>

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Ykesha run towards NPC archers. NO matter what player does, make one live so that the player can see the impact.</code></p>

##### Third Cutscene

No dialogue, just add Spearmen to upcoming waves.

##### Fourth Cutscene

Clearing near top of the map. Player has to move his units into region to win he map. Possibly add a timer. Also, add a chest far away if the player wants to risk getting it and still making the clearing.

<div class="container">
<div class="lemonBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Lemon</p></div>
<blockquote>They're losing too many men. They can't keep this up for long. </blockquote>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="stouBubble bubble"><p class="bubble">Stou</p></div>
<blockquote>Agreed. They're weakest in the North. Perhaps we can sneak by them there. Keep your guard up, and work towards that position.</blockquote>
</div>

Fade to black as your catapult is now mobile and down below.

<div class="container">

<blockquote>We'll help provide a distraction. </blockquote>
</div>

NPC's come out of the gate, and another war machine is added up top.

<p class="action"><span class="emoji">ðŸŽ­</span> <code>Sort of escort goal. Reach a position with all units to complete them map. Waves will come and hold the player up, then delay for a few seconds so that progress is slow but consistent.</code></p>
