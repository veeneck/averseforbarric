Also allows for the largest enemy squads. Only has a base attack. Gradually levels up and sticks around throughout the game.

|:--------:|---------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|------|------|

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n8jaeetcivty7bt/Bad%20Archer%201%20-%20Attack%20Front_01.png?raw=1" width="90" align="left" /> This first enemy archer squad starts the game on the first level as well. They are balanced archers. More distance than crossbows, but less damage. Less range and still affected by line of sight compared to longbowmen, but do more damage.

_Starting Level_: 0

|  Attack  | Defense  | Fortitude | Strength | Agility | Magic | Recruit | Bandage | Max Squad |
|:--------:|----------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Piercing | - | 1         | 2        | 1       | 1     | 1       | 1       | 15        |

### Bad Melee 2 : Drysguard

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/v7omjs4p6t9hq1f/Bad%20Melee%202%20-%20Attack%20Front_01.png?raw=1" width="120" align="left" /> This is the first enemy melee unit to present a different challenge to the player. They do much higher damage, and resist arrows. So, if they get close to your units, they present a bigger threat.

_Starting Level_: 1

|  Attack  | Defense | Fortitude | Strength | Agility | Magic | Recruit | Bandage | Max Squad |
|:--------:|---------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Piercing | Piercing       | 2         | 3        | 2       | 1     | 1       | 1       | 12        |

### Champion : Legionaire

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4lzfn8xk19p8els/Champion%201%20-%20Attack%20Front_01.png?raw=1" width="70" align="left" /> The champion is the default enemy hero unit. He can lead any enemy melee squad, and gives them a bonus to Morale and Strength. Can also play with ideas like dynamic modifiers if UI supports it.

_Starting Level_: 1

|  Attack  | Defense | Fortitude | Strength | Agility | Magic | Recruit | Bandage | Max Squad |
|:--------:|---------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Slashing | Piercing       | 2         | 2        | 2       | 1     | 1       | 1       | 1        |

### Ykesha : Heedless Runners

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/am5j1ocea67kxcl/Ykesha%20-%20Attack%20Front_01.png?raw=1" width="80" align="left" /> This unit may have to change in appearance. Originally, it was to be a high damage low armor unit. If that stays, another unit will have to be added that is a kamikaze, runs fast, and tries to do massive damage to a squad.

_Starting Level_ : 1

| Attack | Defense | Fortitude | Strength | Agility | Magic | Recruit | Bandage | Max Squad |
|:------:|---------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Slashing  | -       | 1         | 2        | 5       | 4     | -       | -       | 1         |

### Rogue : Canyon Shadows

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s6xik98ycaly5bc/Stealth%20Rogue%20-%20Attack%20Front_01.png?raw=1" width="80" align="left" /> The rogue spawns invisibly, so it will always sneak attack and will try to get behind your lines. The first attack also does massive damage. Upgraded rogues can double attack. **Consider**: Rogues either get smoke bomb which makes them disappear right before they die, and reappear across the map partially healed OR rogues get feign death and get to come back at 25% health after they die.

_Starting Level_ : 1

| Attack | Defense | Fortitude | Strength | Agility | Magic | Recruit | Bandage | Max Squad |
|:------:|---------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Piercing  | -       | 1         | 2        | 3       | 2     | -       | -       | 12         |

### Bad Archer 2 : Frigid Bows

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qvdxi61yne8n2dx/Archer%202%20-%20Attack%20Front%20_01.png?raw=1" width="100" align="left" /> Part of Cassandra's army, Bad Archer 2 is the enemy equivalent of longbowmen. No line of sight modifier, and greater range makes them hard to deal with. Additionally, they may get some sort of ice modifier as they level up.

_Starting Level_ : 2

|  Attack  | Defense | Fortitude | Strength | Agility | Magic | Recruit | Bandage | Max Squad |
|:--------:|---------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Piercing | -       | 2         | 3        | 2       | 1     | 1       | 1       | 10        |

### Light Mount : Riders of the Manor

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nrlkmf6qk78i7hr/Lightmount%201%20-%20Attack%20Front_01.png?raw=1" width="100" align="left" /> The light mount is the only enemy mounted unit. With quick attacks, movement, and high dodge they pose a threat to more protected units. They can also evade things like catapults easier. Brings in slow, root, mesmerize spells to effective counter.

_Starting Level_ : 2

|  Attack  | Defense | Fortitude | Strength | Agility | Magic | Recruit | Bandage | Max Squad |
|:--------:|---------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Slashing | -       | 2         | 3        | 5       | 3     | 1       | 1       | 12        |

### Personal Guard : Crescent Shields

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tqs6yhvo28nu2qh/Personal%20Guard%20-%20Attack%20Front_01.png?raw=1" width="80" align="left" /> Cassandra's escort unit. Part of the first round of the final boss fight. They are strong enemy tanks, which makes them resistant to everything. They aren't high threat, but they protect Cassandra who is.

_Starting Level_ : 3

|  Attack  | Defense | Fortitude | Strength | Agility | Magic | Recruit | Bandage | Max Squad |
|:--------:|---------|:---------:|:--------:|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Blunt | Slashing       | 5         | 5        | 3       | 3     | 1       | 1       | 8        |
