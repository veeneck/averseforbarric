Boss units appear at the end of every 3rd level. They will likely have a mulit-wave sequence where their skills change. Generic bosses could reappear later in the game as traditional enemies.

##### Sand Shaman

<img src="/images/wiki/Shaman.png?raw=1" align="left" class="unit" width="100" /> The shaman appears in [Level 3 : City](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-3-:-City) and is our first encounter with a boss. This boss isn't a boss like the others -- it becomes a normal champion later in the game. Other bosses are one time encounters, but this just introduces the player to dealing with enemy spell casters. So, the goal is to treat the unit like a boss during the first 2 sequences, and then make it a traditional squad based unit that can be killed for the final sequence.

**First Sequence**: She appears off screen but can't be attacked. Show player that the enemy can cast spells too.

**Second Sequence**: Continues casting more spells.

**Third Sequence**: Joins an enemy force as their champion, and can finally be killed.



##### Rhino : Iss'dar

<img src="/images/wiki/RhinoBoss.png?raw=1" align="left" class="unit" width="170" /> This man is the leader of the city in [Level 6 : Oasis](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-6-:-Oasis), which is one of the few maps where the NPC is on defense. Currently, there are two attack animations. One for the spearman, and one for the Rhino using its horn. **_Note_**: May need a third or even fourth of the Rhino charging, and of the spearman throwing his spear. Also consider AoE benefits for his friends, and returning to his castle to heal.

**First Sequence**: Take over enemy catapult on far hill, rhino comes out to protect?

**Second Sequence**: Take over oasis, which has been regaining the enemy. Adds green to your troops?

**Third Sequence**: Now that you're in the valley, Rhino man reveals your surrounded. Enemies pour in from all around. Regen should help fight them off.

OR

Rhino man has permanent regen from oasis, plus causes AoE fear in his final phase. This makes it hard to get enough damage in before he heals up again. 

OR 

Rhino man is in a "dead' state ... same visual appearance as cutscene ... resting against a wall. He claims he made a sacrifice to achieve his goal ... to have you surrounded. So, player will think they have won the level only to find themselves surrounded. Like in chess, sacrificing the queen for strategic advantage.



##### War Boss

<img src="/images/wiki/WarBoss.png?raw=1" align="left" class="unit" width="210" /> The War Boss has Barric in chains, and appears in [Level 9 : Fjord](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-9-:-Fjord). Barric is on the back of the machine, while the slave driver has a drum and a whip on the front. There are three main attacks: banging the drum, the whip, and the machine itself. The machine could hit a squad and make units fly. The whip could do base damage, but also have an instant like freezing a unit. The drum could have different wave colors when it is hit. One color could heal friendlies, another could reverse spells, and a final could give allies haste or something along those lines. The player would have to learnt he 3 colors, and adapt.

**First Sequence**: Normal fight.

**Second Sequence**: Boss appears at edge of screen and hits drum to use colored attacks. Can't be attacked by player yet though.

**Third Sequence**: Boss enters combat as a mega HP unit.



##### Cassandra

<img src="/images/wiki/Ice%20Mage%20-%20Attack%201%20Front_01.png?raw=1" class="unit" align="left" width="120" /> Cassy is the final boss appearing in [Level 12 : Castle](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-12-:-Castle) and she comes with two unique friends. Her personal guard are tough, but basic warriors. When she is on the ground with them, she can cast spells and attack. Her spells may be traditional ice spells, and her attack may have a chance to freeze a unit, or something along those lines. Once defeated, she can retreat and return later with her golems. The golems have a double attack. It would also be in character for them to Mirror any harmful spell cast agains them to a nearby enemy. That would make the player strongly consider when to cast. After that, her third form would have to be altering the game systems -- stop Stou from casting, stop war machines, etc. Potential mechanic for her longevity would be for her to clone herself.

**First Sequence**: She is immune to everything except Melee, but her personal guard are super tanks. Figure out how to defeat guard while she dishes out damage, and eventually defeat her until she retreats.

**Second Sequence**: She returns with golems, who mirror all spells you cast.

**Third Sequence**: She returns and clones herself while altering game systems / summoning a ton of units. Try to balance overwhelming odds of defeat with finding the correct clone. Once destroyed, the player wins.
