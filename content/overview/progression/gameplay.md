**:question: Decision** : [Select your base magic type](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Starting-a-New-Game).

Before the player begins, they can choose their preferred magic type. This selection will allow Level 1 to be played without interruption.

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Intro : Scene 1](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Intro-:-Scene-1)

Explains Barric's backstory, and establishes where the player is now. Scene is actually the same scene as level 12, since the first 11 levels are played in the past and the player is brought up to real time.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 1 : Forest](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-1-:-Forest)

Player is introduced to basic mechanics with [Melee1, Melee2 and Archer1](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression). Enemy tactics are introduced with [BadMelee1 and BadArcher1](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression). The player is also given 1 spell, and introduced to [basic spell mechanics](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Stou's-Abilities-Overview).

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Intruder : Scene 2](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Intruder-:-Scene-2)

After battle, our group tries to figure out who is invading. Barric returns to his city while Stou and Cassandra plan to set up an ambush should the attackers follow.

***

**:question: Decision** : [Choose a War Machine](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-War-Machine).

Prior to combat, pick a machine to construct while waiting in ambush. During the next battle cutscene, machine will be revealed.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 2 : Hills](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-2-:-Hills)

Player sees enemy troops scouting party (which contains a champion, foreshadowing what's to come in future levels), and prepares to set up ambush. During first waves, war machine is still under construction, so the player is guided through switching Stou's spell stances since they received a new spell when completing level 1. Then, [Trebuchet or Catapult](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression) comes out, and battle continues. 

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Distraction : Scene 3](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Distraction-:-Scene-3)

Stou and Cassandra realize a small distraction force was sent to keep them occupied while the full army marched on Barric's city.

*** 

**:mans_shoe: Travel Dialogue** : [Reveal Level 2 to Level 3](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-2-to-Level-3)

***

**:earth_americas: World Map** : [Explain Camp scene](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/World-Map)

By this point, the first unit should have leveled up. Explain how to recruit, heal, and upgrade units in the camp.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 3 : City](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-3-:-City)

This is the first boss fight. Start with the city under attack, and Stou comes to the rescue. [BadMelee2 and Champion](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#bad-melee-2--unnamed) enemy are first encountered. Then, the army reforms to defend the city. After that, the [Shaman boss scenario](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Boss-Unit-Progression) plays out.

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Decision : Scene 4](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-Scene-4)

*** 

**:question: Decision** : [Helping Hand](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-Helping-Hand
).

Before leaving town, choose a friendly unit to help. That unit will join you just before Level 7 : Foothills.

***

**:mans_shoe: Travel Dialogue** : [Reveal Level 3 to Level 3a](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-3-to-Level-3a)

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 3a : Change of Plans](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-3a-:-Change-of-Plans)

This is not really a fight, but it loads and starts like one. Stou's army is walking and hits a crossroads. They start to proceed towards the council, and then Cassandra and her troops rush from behind. They get him to change directions and assist the border, while she will notify the council. By doing this in level, we can see Cassandra's gameplay figure, and her personal guard, which will come back in the final boss battle.

***

**:mans_shoe: Travel Dialogue** : [Reveal Level 3a to Level 4](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-3a-to-Level-4)

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Siege : Scene 5](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Siege-:-Scene-5)

Stou arrives to help the border. They don't know why they're being attacked. Reinforcements haven't arrived from Barric's city. Sotu wants to proceed into borderlands to find out more, waits for clearing in the waves of attacks.

*** 

**:question: Decision** : [Ranged Help](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-Ranged-Help).

Prior to combat, pick an archer to help fend off enemies that charge and explode.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 4 : Border](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-4-:-Border)

The border is under attack, so you mostly defend the castle. You're given [Longbowmen or Crossbowmen](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#longbowmen--unnamed) to help counter the new, faster moving enemy units: [Ykesha and Spearmen](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#ykesha--unnamed). Shaman will probably make an appearance again to reinforce the idea that it is a champion unit now and not a boss.

***

**:question: Decision** : [Spearmen](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-Spearmen).

Enemy troops ([Spearmen](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#spearmen--unnamed)) don't agree with the war and want to join your forces.

***

**:mans_shoe: Travel Dialogue** : [Reveal Level 4 to Level 5](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-4-to-Level-5)

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Warning : Scene 6](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Warning-:-Scene-6)

Cassandra's troops saw Barric leave his city with the enemy. Fears Barric may be behind this. Stou disagrees, proceeds further renter drylands for answers.

*** 

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 5 : Desert](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-5-:-Desert)

This is the first appearance of enemy [Rogues](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#rogue--unnamed). Whether or not you accept the Spearmen earlier, they will come save you and explain rogues during this fight. After that, it will be a standard mission, with a focus on protecting the high ground and detecting more rogues.

***

**:mans_shoe: Travel Dialogue** : [Reveal Level 5 to Level 6](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-5-to-Level-6)

***

**:question: Decision** : [Siege Planning](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-Siege-Planning).

Sharpen blades or arrows, which provides permanent buff to archers or melee.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 6 : Oasis](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-6-:-Oasis)

The entirety of this battle is geared around the [Rhino Boss Fight](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Boss-Unit-Progression#rhino). Unlike a final boss, this boss keeps coming out, fighting, and then retreating to heal. So, there should be various objectives around the map to take before finally being able to kill him.

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Betrayal : Scene 7](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Betrayal-:-Scene-7)

Somehow the main enemy forces followed Stou, which will stop his quest for answers short. The Rhino boss hints at betrayal, but Cassandra suggests they flee before finding out more.

*** 

**:question: Decision** : [Loot City](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-Loot-City).

Loot city, or leave untouched.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 7 : Foothills](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-7-:-Foothills)

[Melee3 or Flail1](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#flail--unnamed) will join you here based on a prior decision. When the level begins, you help them and they join you. Then, you are pushed to set up defenses. Then, final end point opens up and it becomes escort mission to get to edge of map.

***

**:mans_shoe: Travel Dialogue** : Reveal Level 7 to Level 7a

No dialogue, just footsteps to the crossroads.

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Crossroads : Scene 8](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Crossroads-:-Scene-8)

Stou heads to mountains to delay enemy and reinforce. Cassandra heads to notify the council.

Prepare for upcoming fight.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 8 : Mountain](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-8-:-Mountain)

First couple of wave are normal. Maybe introduce Ykesha unit that can climb, so that you can be flanked. Eventually, [giant](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#giant--unnamed) joins. He will fight both armies. Flee / mez / run to manipulate him into killing enemies. Enemy birds that can only be hit by archers would also be a good addition for this level.

***

**:question: Decision** : [Giant](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Decision-:-Giant).

After battle, heal giant for him to join your party, or finish off and get great rewards.

***

**:mans_shoe: Travel Dialogue** : [Reveal Level 8 to Level 9](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-8-to-Level-9)

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Fjord : Scene 9](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Fjord-:-Scene-9)

City is abandoned. No reinforcements. Where did Cassandra's force go? No time to figure out, enemy has caught up and it's time to fight.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 9 : Fjord](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-9-:-Fjord)

This is the boss fight with [Barric / War Drums](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Boss-Unit-Progression#war-boss). This should combine every tactic learned so far. The boss is a mega hp unit that bangs drums, which emit different colors, to generate temporary status effects.

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [BroDown : Scene 10](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/BroDown-:-Scene-10)

Stou accidentally kills Barric because he doesn't realize the boss had him in chains as a prisoner.

Stou stumbles across this farm where [armored knights](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Friendly-Unit-Progression#heavy-mount--unnamed) were trying to get to the council's camp. Stou is happy to see there is a friendly force gathering, so his spirits rise. The army on this map is a combo of Cassandra's forces and units you've fought up until now. [Bad Archer 2 and Light Mount](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Enemy-Unit-Progression#bad-archer-2--unnamed) are revealed.

***

**:earth_americas: World Map** : [Camp Revealed](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/World-Map)

***

**:movie_camera:  Movie** : [Camp : Scene 11](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Camp-:-Scene-11)

Now caught up in real time, Stou and Alfric make plans.

***

Determines which buffs to give for coming battle.

***

**:hocho: Battle** : [Level 11 : Camp](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-11-:-Camp)

This is a sort of ambush map. It is night time, and the enemy catches you off guard. Starts with rogues entering the camp, and calling in their friends. After each wave, the player gets one more unit to wake up and add to the fight.

***

**:mans_shoe: Travel Dialogue** : [Reveal Level 11 to Level 12](https://github.com/veeneck/Barric/wiki/Level-11-to-Level-12)
