title: "Soundtrack"

[Tony Manfredonia](https://www.manfredoniamusic.com) reached out to me in January 2015, and we did a brief trial. It went so smoothly that I gladly had him work on the entire soundtrack. In the end, he crafted over 30 minutes of unique content tailored to very specific aspects of the game. Below is a sample of the types of music he made along with the in game considerations.

### Main Menu

I have listened to this piece thousands of times because it always loads when I'm testing, and it still hasn't gotten old. I'm convinced it is iconic. In addition to the wonderful main loop, I also wanted a string sound to play when the user entered the game. This string sound had to both play on top of the main track at any point, and be a unique identifier throughout key events in the game. Tony nailed it with a sorrowful sound that can't be missed each time it is encountered. To top it off, he gave me variations of these tracks the first time the user plays the game (extended), and for quicker entry on subsequent loads.

### Story

After [Brian saved me with scene timing](/motion), I had a complete deliverable to pass on to Tony. With that, Tony could time the music to events and motion in the cutscenes. For the most part, the music served as ambiance with just a touch of impact where needed. He delivered these slightly overstated, which allowed Brian to fade in and out where needed for an additional impact.  These scenes were subject to revision, during which Tony was patient and flexible. He also built versions with intro and exit timing in case the UI needs to present anything.

### Combat

I've always loved games that use music to cue events or changes that are occurring. I wanted some aspect of that to be used in this game, so I worked with Tony to create layers for the battle track. First, each quarter of the game is set in a unique location, so the battle tracks compliment the location. Second, when you are about to win a level, the track starts to change. See the 75% track to the right and notice how the guitar is layered in.  Finally, when a boss is about to come into play, the music is at its most intense. Since this is all layered, I can easily crossfade to an exact timestamp in the desired track.

### World Map

Following the Main Menu, the World Map has got to be one of the most recognized musical aspects of a game. If I recall correctly, my request of Tony was something that inspired adventure, hope, a splash of dispair, and a seamless loop. If you listen to the track in full, you'll see that it hits all of those notes. I particularly love around 1:05 when the sorrow kicks in and parts of the Main Menu are repurposed. To top it off, Tony provided a 15 second travel track for me to use when events on the World Map are unfolding. That travel track transitions perfectly back into the main track at any point.


#### Thank You, Tony

In hindsight, I'm fortunate to have found someone who was willing to work on such specific aspects of the game and timing versus just making general background tracks. Even more so considering I was working on an indie budget. As an unexpected bonus, Tony was a huge motivator and truly cared about the development of the game. As a novice coming into this, I'm grateful for Tony walking me through this, and I wish I had an excuse to work with him again.
