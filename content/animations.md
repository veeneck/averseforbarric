title: "Animations"
---

I began working with [Liron Peer](http://www.lironpeer.com) in late 2014 on character animations. Of all the specialties, finding an animator who could work on isometric material was the biggest challenge. I spent over $1,000 on trial runs through various animators with no luck. Once I found Liron and she nailed her first attempt, we jumped straight in to the entire contract. In total, she produced over 1,000 hand drawn frames. Here are a few of them:

<div class="animationFavs">
<div class="crossbow">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="ryler">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="idiri">&nbsp;</div>
</div>

Now, I did place quite a few limitations on Liron. First, almost all of the animations had to be 8 frames. We made exceptions for a few to reach 12 frames. Second, most of the characters are only 64x64 pixels so a lot of details will be lost. Third, each animation must be a full cycle and the characters feet must return to the same position or stay completely still.

bonus..type projectile to the scroll bar so people can go through frame by frame.

#### Thanks, Liron

Liron's discipline was a welcome addition to the project. I gave her all files broken apart with notes, and she returned the properly positioned, high quality frames along with preview gifs. Everything was done orderly, promptly and correctly. I would highly recommend working with her. Any changes were listened to and fixed. Like all of the other contractors I worked with, I hope to have an excuse to work with Liron again someday.
