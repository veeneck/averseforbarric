title: "Motion Graphics"
---

The term _motion graphics_ doesn't justify the help that Brian Campbell provided on this project. He began contributing in March 2015 as a video editor for cutscenes. That alone was huge. At the time, I had the story written and art for the scenes designed. I quickly stitched them together in iMovie to get a sense for pacing. Fortunately, Brian [does this stuff for a living](http://secretpowers.com) so he knew exactly what needed to happen to move things forward. Have a look at these two scenes side by side:

<div class="outtake">
<video width="42%" controls>
  <source src="/images/intruder_original_web.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video width="56%" controls>
  <source src="/images/Intruder_web.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</div>

The improvement to the cutscene is obvious, but the gains didn't stop there. To get each cutscene to this point, Brian setup a process which:

- **Improved the Script**
- **Added Voice for Timing**
- **Rigged Each Scene**
- **Provided Timing Cues for Music**
