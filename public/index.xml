      <description>The term motion graphics doesn&amp;rsquo;t justify the help that Brian Campbell provided on this project. He began contributing in March 2015 as a video editor for cutscenes. That alone was huge. At the time, I had the story written and art for the scenes designed. I quickly stitched them together in iMovie to get a sense for pacing. Fortunately, Brian does this stuff for a living so he knew exactly what needed to happen to move things forward.</description>

      <description>Tony Manfredonia reached out to me in January 2015, and we did a brief trial. It went so smoothly that I gladly had him work on the entire soundtrack. In the end, he crafted over 30 minutes of unique content tailored to very specific aspects of the game. Below is a sample of the types of music he made along with the in game considerations.
 Main Menu I have listened to this piece thousands of times because it always loads when I&amp;rsquo;m testing, and it still hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten old.</description>
