      <description>High damage, low control, low debuffs, low healing.
Aggressive spells are meant to kill the enemy before they can kill you. This is done by direct damage, or by increasing the damage your units can do. The spells also compliment one another, so that when stacked can do massive damage. Drawback will be along the lines of damaging friendly units, creating unpredictable outcomes, or some other negative consideration. All of the spells use Fire as the element.</description>

      <description>I began working with Liron Peer in late 2014 on character animations. Of all the specialties, finding an animator who could work on isometric material was the biggest challenge. I spent over $1,000 on trial runs through various animators with no luck. Once I found Liron and she nailed her first attempt, we jumped straight in to the entire contract. In total, she produced over 1,000 hand drawn frames. Here are a few of them:</description>

STOU and CASSANDRA interrogating ISS&amp;rsquo;DAR after the battle.
Stou
 Why do you attack us? Who leads this assault? Tell me, now.  Iss&#39;dar
 You fool. The answer is in front of you.  Stou
 You dare give me riddles?  Iss&#39;dar
 Are you so blind? You&#39;ve been betrayed.  
Enemy army appears on the horizon.

 We were followed ... how? They didn&#39;t know we were here.</description>

      <description>Boss units appear at the end of every 3rd level. They will likely have a mulit-wave sequence where their skills change. Generic bosses could reappear later in the game as traditional enemies.
Sand Shaman The shaman appears in Level 3 : City and is our first encounter with a boss. This boss isn&amp;rsquo;t a boss like the others &amp;ndash; it becomes a normal champion later in the game. Other bosses are one time encounters, but this just introduces the player to dealing with enemy spell casters.</description>

      <description>The idea behind the Camp scene is that every squad based action can be handled here. Recruit units, upgrading units, healing units, equipping items and assigning a hero to the squad. The other goal was for each action to have an immediate visual effect. For example, if you recruit a new Lemon Knight, the squad should be visible, centered on the screen and the new unit should briefly walk to join the squad.</description>

 So, Barric is truly gone then. It hurts to say that out loud. That traitorous b... clearly her father&#39;s blood runs deep.  Stou

      <description>To date, this game has 38,378 lines of Swift code. There have been countless hours invested in art, story, design, animation and brainstorming, but code makes all of this tick. Behind the scenes, SpriteKit and GameplayKit power a vast majority of the engine. This section provides a look at some of the custom frameworks that had to be developed along with tricky problems that had to be solved.

      <description>The UI elements during a battle have to respect a few situations:
 They must be large enough for taps on mobile. They must be concise enough to avoid clutter on smaller screens. They must be quick enough for a series of complex actions to affect strategy.  With that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;ve broken down the major sections of the UI and explained the ideal way for them to operate. It&amp;rsquo;s not out of the question to make a separate UI for different screen sizes, but designing with a mobile first emntality will ensure everything is covered.</description>

      <guid>/overview/abilities/controlling/</guid>
      <description>Moderate damage, high control, moderate debuffs, low healing.
Controlling spells will probably be the most difficult to play. They will requires more switching between spell categories. For example, mesmerize a unit, then switch to Protective and play for awhile, then switch back to Controlling. They also have wave based triggers (wave starts, heal units), so the player will have to switch at the correct timing. All of the spells use Wind / Mind as the element.</description>

STOU and CASSANDRA at crossroads deciding next steps.
Stou
 Still they persist.  Cassandra
 Perhaps, we should split up.  Stou
 I don&#39;t enjoy the idea of dividing our forces. Or, of leaving you.  Cassandra
 Nor do I, but hear me. Lure them into the mountains, distract them, I will alert the council.  Stou
 I don&#39;t like this, Cassandra. But, you&#39;re right.</description>

STOU and CASSANDRA consult with BARRIC after the battle at SOUTH KEEP
Cassandra
 Our ambush was avoided.  Barric
 I know, and had we pressed the attack, our city would have been left defenseless. We must not overreact.  Stou
 Overreact? They attacked our city, Barric. Our home!  Barric
 And who exactly are &#34;they&#34;?  Stou
 This matters when they bring war to our very doorstep?</description>

 It seems the attack was but a small diversion all the while the real threat marched from the south.  Stou

Bad Melee 1 : Border Squires This is the first and most common enemy unit, and it counters Melee 1. Also allows for the largest enemy squads. Only has a base attack. Gradually levels up and sticks around throughout the game.</description>

 They left, sir. About 2 3 weeks past. Marching towards the war.  Stou

      <description>These are the units that the player will be able to recruit throughout the game. One playthrough will not guarantee all units are collected. Some are either-or type decisions. Also, once a unit has been obtained, there is still a chance they will leave. The goal is for the army size to be consistent, which will keep the game balanced.

      <description>Scott Pellico was a godsend for this project. After a few trial runs with other artists, I was having trouble establishing an art direction. My brother, Chris, found Scott for his project. Since Chris didn&amp;rsquo;t need Scott full time, Scott agreed to split his work between the two of us. He worked on the project part time for nearly a year starting in 2014. Before getting into specific contributions, here is a gallery of some of my favorite Scott creations.</description>

 No. We must return to South Keep and warn our people.  Stou

As Stou left the mountains, he could not accept that he killed Barric, nor could he accept his inability to see betrayal that was right in front of him. His lust for battle lost him a brother. So, he wandered on. Perhaps the burning farm in the distance would provide him with a purpose.

      <description>The term motion graphics doesn&amp;rsquo;t justify the help that Brian Campbell provided on this project. He began contributing in March 2015 as a video editor for cutscenes. That alone was huge. At the time, I had the story written and art for the scenes designed. I quickly stitched them together in iMovie to get a sense for pacing. Fortunately, Brian does this stuff for a living so he knew exactly what needed to happen to move things forward.</description>

      <description>I wish I remember who I heard it from, but the idea was that players enjoy decisions. The more you can add, the better. To take it a step further, if a decision now can impact the game later, that&amp;rsquo;s even better. There shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be decisions just for the sake of decisions &amp;ndash; they should affect the story or gameplay in some way. That&amp;rsquo;s the goal with this scene. Each time a decision is available (after combat, during travel, etc), this scene will be presented with a choice.</description>

      <description>Low damage, low control, low debuffs, high healing.
Protective spells are meant to keep your friendlies alive. This is done by direct healing, revival, or by limiting the amount of damage an enemy can do. Crowd control is minimal, with Hammer being the only hope of Fear / Stun in a hard fight. Healing can be boring, so one future task is to brainstorm creative ways to add variety to healing.</description>

Major Game Engine Features To Be Considered Code that I haven&amp;rsquo;t added yet.
Flanking bonus Strategic positions Treasure chests Larger maps Heroes Items Difficulty Level Boss Fights Player places units Hidden units (i.e: placed behind tree)  Difficulty Level Games are annoying when you have to start them over completely &amp;ndash; especially story heavy games. One option is to offer easy mode and normal mode.</description>

STOU and ARCHER are atop Drysgate discussing the siege.
Stou
 Report?  Archer
 They&#39;re attacking with scout groups. Pinning us back as they continue to grow their ranks.  Stou
 Do we know why they&#39;re attacking?  Archer
 No, sir. They&#39;ve sent no messages. Only arrows.  Stou
 And who is that? Who leads them?  Archer
 The man in the cloak?</description>

STOU and CASSANDRA preparing for the final battle.
Cassandra
 Oh, Stou. I&#39;m surprised you made it this far. For what it&#39;s worth, I respected your brother. Despite the fact he took everything from me. My father. My kingdom. My heritage. Was he so foolish as to think that a discarded mountain city would be suitable for one such as myself? For royalty? My birthright is to rule.</description>

      <description>Tony Manfredonia reached out to me in January 2015, and we did a brief trial. It went so smoothly that I gladly had him work on the entire soundtrack. In the end, he crafted over 30 minutes of unique content tailored to very specific aspects of the game. Below is a sample of the types of music he made along with the in game considerations.
 Main Menu I have listened to this piece thousands of times because it always loads when I&amp;rsquo;m testing, and it still hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten old.</description>

      <description>All of my favorite games are story driven, so I wanted to bring that into this project. Fortunately, Brian Campbell has been a huge help here in both the script and the cutscene sequences. When I get a full length video of the story as a whole, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it here. Until then, please browser the scenes in the menu to the right for a scene-by-scene breakdown and playback.</description>

      <description>A place to store random tech notes for reference when designing things.
Modifiers There are a few types of modifiers in the game, and they are all applied in different ways. Here&amp;rsquo;s the breakdown of how a unit might get a modifier applied to it.
 Spell Modifiers: Each spell applies a modifier to the target squad / units and this can be overridden on the spell level. Spells are abilities, and they should process ability modifiers the same way combat modifiers do, but they currently don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>As each level is completed, the next level is revealed. This seemed like a good time to add some character building. It also serves as a vehicle to drop hints or influence the way the player may feel. So, for now, the implementation is to gradually reveal footsteps and have Stou speak in the background about current events and thoughts. Each segment takes around 7 to 12 seconds. Tony added a background track that can fade into the main World map track once the dialogue is complete.</description>

      <title>Units &amp; Their Progression</title>

      <description>Unit progression is a tricky topic and requires a lot of play testing to truly balance it. So, to start, I&amp;rsquo;m approaching it at a basic level that has room to be tailored. The order in which Friendly Units, Enemy Units and Boss Units appear is fairly though out, but their attributes and abilities are currently in a basic state.
The overall goal is for Stou (the player) to be the deciding factor.</description>

 Cassandra? What are you doing here? You were to notify the council.  Cassandra
 I ... your brother. I had to come immediately. Barric. He left South Keep shortly after you we did ... with those who stand against us.</description>

      <description>Moderate damage, moderate control, moderate debuffs, moderate healing.
Watchful spells are well balanced. They should be able to heal units, buff units, resist damage, do damage, and offer crowd control. All while being the master of none. If the player preempts everything that is about to happen, Watchful should feel a bit overpowered. But, it should feel underpowered if the player is being reactive. For example, Regen should not save a unit close to death, but it should keep a unit alive is constantly applied throughout the fight.</description>

      <description>The world map serves as the main way to show passage of time or travel. Aside from that, it also builds the setting and acts as a hub where the player can manage their army. The main characters in this world are:
 Barric: One of the council lords, and Stou&amp;rsquo;s older brother. Stou: Barric&amp;rsquo;s younger brother who the player is controlling. Alfric: The knight Stou is talking to at the beginning.</description>
